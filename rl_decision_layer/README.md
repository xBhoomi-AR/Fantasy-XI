# RL decision layer

Candidate-generation foundation for the future PPO/MILP decision layer. No
PPO, MILP, or environment code here yet - this only turns XGBoost's
predictions into a usable candidate pool per gameweek.

Only consumes `models/xgboost_model`'s output files (predictions CSV, raw
player/team data, pre-computed form columns) - never its training internals.
That keeps this swappable if the BiLSTM model becomes the prediction source
later.

## Layout

```
rl_decision_layer/
├── predictions/interface.py   # canonical prediction schema (the joins)
├── candidates/
│   ├── ranking.py              # rank each position separately
│   ├── candidate_pool.py       # top-K + squad + form, DGW-aware
│   └── pipeline.py             # get_candidates(gw, squad) - the entry point
└── tests/test_day1_pipeline.py
```

## Canonical prediction fields

`player_id, player_name, web_name, position, team_id, team_name,
opponent_team_id, season, gameweek, fixture_id, was_home_int,
fixture_difficulty, price, predicted_points, form_avg3/5/10/38`

Sources and join keys are documented in `predictions/interface.py`. `price`
is FPL's tenths-of-a-million convention (e.g. `53` = £5.3m), confirmed from
the 5-154 range across the whole dataset - no scale conversion applied,
just renamed from `value`.

## Candidate selection

Per position, the pool is the union of:
- prediction top-K (`DEFAULT_PREDICTION_TOP_K`)
- current squad (kept regardless of rank)
- recent form top-K by `form_avg5` (`DEFAULT_FORM_TOP_K`)

Defaults are sized against FPL's fixed squad slots (2 GK/5 DEF/5 MID/3 FWD),
not empirically tuned - override them per experiment.

**Double gameweeks**: a player with two fixtures in one gameweek is
collapsed into a single candidate row with predicted_points summed across
both fixtures (`fixture_count` records how many). Fixture-specific fields
(opponent, home/away) keep the first fixture's values, since a single row
can't represent two different fixtures - MILP will need to deal with DGWs
explicitly when it gets there.

## Leakage rule

Predictions and form for gameweek G only ever use data from before G - this
is enforced upstream in the XGBoost feature pipeline (shift-before-roll),
not recomputed here. The test suite independently recomputes `form_avg3`
from raw match stats for a few sampled players per gameweek and checks it
matches, rather than just trusting the code path.

## Entry point

```python
from rl_decision_layer.candidates.pipeline import get_candidates

pool = get_candidates(target_gameweek=20, current_squad_ids=[1, 2, 3, ...])
```

This is what the historical environment (once it exists) should call each
step - it doesn't need to know about `interface.py` or `ranking.py`.

## Running tests

```
python rl_decision_layer/tests/test_day1_pipeline.py
```

Needs `model_features.csv` to have real content, not a Git LFS pointer -
regenerate locally with `python models/xgboost_model/scripts/build_features.py`
if needed.
